# monopoly
Board game "Monopoly", implemented in C# on Windows.Forms at .Net Framework 4.7.2. Two game modes are available: single player (two players take turns on one client application) and multiplayer (two players connect to the server). The interaction of the multiplayer mode is implemented using TCP.

For multiplayer mode, you need to be inside the same local network (using emulators is also a solution).

Server connection parameters are set in the "config.ini" configuration file in the application directory. The structure is given in the repository.

Good luck and have fun!
